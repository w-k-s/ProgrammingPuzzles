# Challenge


The goal of this challenge is to design a cash register program. You will be given two decimal numbers. 
- The first is the purchase price (PP) of the item. 
- The second is the cash (CH) given by the customer. 

Your register currently has the following bills/coins within it:

'PENNY': .01,
'NICKEL': .05,
'DIME': .10,
'QUARTER': .25,
'HALF DOLLAR': .50,
'ONE': 1.00,
'TWO': 2.00,
'FIVE': 5.00,
'TEN': 10.00,
'TWENTY': 20.00,
'FIFTY': 50.00,
'ONE HUNDRED': 100.00

The aim of the program is to calculate the change that has to be returned to the customer.
Input:

## Input

Your program should read lines of text from standard input. Each line contains two numbers which are separated by a semicolon. The first is the Purchase price (PP) and the second is the cash(CH) given by the customer.

## Output

For each line of input print a single line to standard output which is the change to be returned to the customer. In case the CH < PP, print out ERROR. If CH == PP, print out ZERO. For all other cases print the amount that needs to be returned, in terms of the currency values provided. The output should be alphabetically sorted.

## Test 1

### Test Input
